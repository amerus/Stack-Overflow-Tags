##### Midterm Capstone Project for Nashville Software School Data Science Program
### Visual Tag Analysis of Two Language-Specific Stack Overflow Communities: English and Russian

### Overview

Stack Overflow has many groups separated by interests. Search of Stack Overflow is facilitated by proper topic tagging. Stack Exchange can be used to query Stack Overflow tags (and explore their popularity). Russian Stack Overflow is also a large and active community. Comparing tags of the English-speaking Stack Overflow to the Russian counterpart may reveal interesting trends.

### Motivation

As an IT professional, I use Stack Overflow frequently. Sometimes there are answers on the Russian site, which cannot be found within the English-speaking community. Data Camp has a project, which explores Stack Overflow tags as a way of finding the most popular programming languages. However, the Data Camp project lacks:
* R Shiny app to facilitate interactive trend discovery and 
* tag analysis of the Russian-speaking community

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses

**Null Hypothesis**:
Russian and English tags of Stack Overflow belong to the same population group (Russian Stack Overflow is simply a smaller subset of the same tag space).\
**Alternative Hypothesis**:
Russian and English tags of Stack Overflow represent two different population groups (with distinct tags and popularity).
